Privacy Policy for QR Code Studio

Last Updated: July 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how "QR Code Studio" ("we," "us," or "our") operates and handles data. Our commitment is to protect your privacy.

**Data Collection and Usage**

"QR Code Studio" is designed to work entirely on your local machine (client-side). We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, personally identifiable information, or any other user data.

All data you input into the extension (such as URLs, Wi-Fi credentials, vCard information, or cryptocurrency addresses) is used exclusively for the purpose of generating a QR code on your device. This information is processed ephemerally and is never sent to any external server or saved by the extension.

**Permissions**

The extension requests the `activeTab` permission for one specific function: to automatically read the URL of the current webpage when you open the extension, for your convenience. This URL is only read upon user action and is not stored or tracked.

**No Remote Code**

The extension does not use any remote code. All executable logic is included in the extension package that you download from the Chrome Web Store.
